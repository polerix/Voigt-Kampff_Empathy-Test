This is a python implementation of the Voight-Kampff Empathy Test from the Movie "Bladerunner" and to an extent the novel "Do androids dream of electric sheep".

This is my iterpretation of the terminal screen used to ask the questions, matching sensor data, and provide a FICTIONAL diagnostic of REPLICANTS or HUMANS.

The Voigt-Kampff Empathy Test was a test designed to distinguish androids from humans by determining the subject's ability to empathize. The test was not perfect, as some humans with mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, could conceivably fail.

This python driven version is designed to run on 
“normal” size terminal at 80 columns by 24 rows.

The end product will be running on a raspberry pi, with CO2, O2, Altitude, sensors, as well as a webcam aimed at an eye.

The interviewer will use arrow keys on a keyboard to navigate the menus.
