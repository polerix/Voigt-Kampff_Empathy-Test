This Python script implements the Voight-Kampff Empathy Test from the movie *Blade Runner* and, to some extent, the novel *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*

It is my interpretation of the terminal interface used to present questions, correlate sensor data, and generate a fictional diagnostic to determine whether the subject is a REPLICANT or HUMAN.

The Voight-Kampff Empathy Test was designed to distinguish androids from humans by measuring their capacity for empathy. However, the test had limitations; for instance, some humans with mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, might fail the test.


The final version will run on a Raspberry Pi and integrate various sensors, including CO2, O2, and altitude sensors, as well as a webcam aimed at the subject's eye. The interviewer will navigate the interface using arrow keys on a keyboard.

The original Voigt Empathy Test was developed by the Pavlov Institute in the Soviet Union after some T-14 androids managed to remain undetected for up to a year. Around 1989/2018, Lurie Kampff modified the Voigt scale, creating the Voight-Kampff Altered Scale, which became the standard method of testing. 

Bounty hunters themselves were required to pass the test before using it on suspected androids. In early 1992/2021, bounty hunter Dave Holden administered the test to three Nexus-6 androids. During the third test, android Max Polokov shot Holden and escaped. Rick Deckard then took over Holden's assignment, conducting tests on Rachael Rosen, Luba Luft, and Phil Resch.

The Voight-Kampff test first appeared in *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* and was later featured in its film adaptation, *Blade Runner*. While the spelling was altered in the movie, the original spelling was retained in the 1997 video game and the continuation novels by K. W. Jeter.

I do not claim ownership of the Voight-Kampff name, *Blade Runner*, or any associated intellectual property. 

This project is purely a personal work of art, created for self-education and non-commercial purposes.
